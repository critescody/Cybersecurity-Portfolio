The correlation between casino losses, times of losses, player winnings, and dealer schedules all align to suggest that the player Mylie Schmidt was colluding 
with dealer Billy Jones to steal money from the casino.  There were 13 instances of Mylie Schmidt winning funds from the casino and during each of her
winning sessions the dealer Billy Jones was assigned to work the table.

Recommend prosecution for both Mylie Schmidt and Billy Jones for theft of funds.
